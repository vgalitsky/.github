## About Concept Ecosystem

**Concept Ecosystem** is a modern PHP development framework founded by Viktor Halytskiy, built on the principles of **configuration-driven architecture**, **PSR standards compliance**, and **SOLID design principles**. The ecosystem provides a comprehensive set of modular, interoperable packages that enable developers to build robust, maintainable applications through configuration rather than code.

### Philosophy

The Concept Ecosystem embraces several core principles:

- **Configuration-Driven Architecture**: Build entirely different applications (REST APIs, web apps, CLI tools) through configuration alone, without changing code. The powerful [Config package](https://github.com/Concept-Labs/config) provides variable interpolation, imports, includes, and plugin extensibility.

- **Dependency Injection First**: Fully integrated with the [Singularity DI Container](https://github.com/Concept-Labs/singularity) (PSR-11 compliant), featuring advanced lifecycle management (Transient, Shared, Weak, Prototype), lazy loading, autowiring, and plugin architecture.

- **PSR Standards Compliance**: All packages strictly follow PHP-FIG standards:
  - PSR-4 (Autoloading)
  - PSR-7 (HTTP Messages) 
  - PSR-11 (Container Interface)
  - PSR-12 (Extended Coding Style)
  - PSR-15 (HTTP Handlers)

- **SOLID Principles**: Clean, maintainable, testable code architecture with clear separation of concerns and single responsibility.

- **Lazy Initialization**: Components are only instantiated when actually needed, improving performance and resource efficiency.

- **Modular & Extensible**: Each package serves a specific purpose and can be used independently or as part of the ecosystem. Plugin systems allow easy extension without modifying core code.

### Core Packages

The ecosystem includes several key packages:

- **[singularity](https://github.com/Concept-Labs/singularity)**: Advanced PSR-11 DI container with dependency injection, lifecycle management, autowiring, and plugin system
- **[config](https://github.com/Concept-Labs/config)**: Powerful configuration management with dot notation, variable interpolation, imports/includes, and multiple format support (JSON, PHP, YAML)
- **[http](https://github.com/Concept-Labs/http)**: Low-level HTTP application foundation with middleware pipeline (PSR-7, PSR-15), built on configuration-driven architecture
- **[simple-http](https://github.com/Concept-Labs/simple-http)**: Higher-level HTTP application with additional features built on top of the http package

### Real-World Applications

The Concept Ecosystem has been successfully used in production environments:

- **Aghawk Dynamics CRM Portal**: Full-stack customer portal using PHP 8.2, Concept Ecosystem, MySQL, JavaScript, and React for a drone solutions provider
- **NL-tuning E-commerce Platform**: Custom framework with PSR-compliant components for a Swiss auto-tuning company
- Various custom web applications and APIs leveraging the modular architecture
